## Introduction
I'm Zhi Heng 🙋🏻‍♂️, a Computer Engineering fresh graduate from Nanyang Technological University 👨🏻‍🎓.

Wondering why I decided to pursue Computer Engineering 🖥️ instead of Computer Science 🧪? Keyword, Flexibility 💪🏻. By majoring in Computer Engineering, it enables me to get the best of both worlds, where I would have knowledge in the Hardware side of things and the Software side of things. 

So, how did I get into it? During my time at Temasek Polytechnic, I was given the opportunity to participate in Microsoft's Imagine Cup 2017, gaining exposure in developing Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, working with cloud technologies ☁️ and also developing mobile applications 📱.  

Even after the competition, I was involved in a faculty led project, named MyWater 💧, as a front-end developer and at times assisting the hardware developers, the project was poised to be a smart water meter that was able to detect leakages and water consumption through the water mains without the need of cutting into the water mains. Although the project didn't take off, it spurred my interest in building IoT applications, and my passion for entrepreneurship.

My passion for entrepreneurship led me to found my first business venture with my friends, which was called Chargit 🔋. Chargit was positioned to be a point-to-point power bank rental service, during the days where power banks were expensive yet in demand. However, the business didn't take off due to the monstrous capital investments that was required, and also the increasing ownership of power banks.

As for my most recent project, I recently started a home-based business with my friend, selling homemade ice creams and cold brews 🍨☕️. The branding, design, and development of the business's website was led by myself with input from my friend. This was the first production project that I hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

Why did I start this business? The 8 years of experience that I have working part time at Swensen's. Being able to see my guests, especially kids, faces light up whenever I plate up and serve their desserts was very likely the reason why I decided to pursue this business.
